Hi, I’m Jayanth 👋  

ECE student focused on working close to the hardware — from bare-metal embedded systems
to RTL design and processor microarchitecture.

I enjoy building things from scratch, understanding how they work internally,
and making sure I can explain every design decision.

🔧 Areas I work in
- Embedded systems (STM32, ESP32, RTOS)
- Bare-metal driver development
- Verilog HDL and RTL design
- RISC-V based processor design

📌 Selected projects(working)
- 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor
- RTOS-Driven Low-Power Sensor Fusion Firmware for ARM Cortex-M SoCs
- Bare-Metal Bootloader & Memory Map Implementation for ARM-Based Embedded Systems
- Design & Verification of a Configurable AXI-Lite Interconnect for SoC Subsystems
