Hi, I’m Jayanth 👋  

ECE student focused on working close to the hardware — from bare-metal embedded systems
to RTL design and processor microarchitecture.

I enjoy building things from scratch, understanding how they work internally,
and making sure I can explain every design decision.

🔧 Areas I work in
- Embedded systems (STM32, ESP32, RTOS)
- Bare-metal driver development
- Verilog HDL and RTL design
- RISC-V based processor design

📌 Selected projects
- 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor
- RTOS-Based Multi-Sensor Data Acquisition System
- Bare-Metal I2C Master Driver
- 32 Bit ALU using Verilog HDL
